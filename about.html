<h1><center><i><u>OVERVIEW</u></i></center></br></h1>
</br>
<p><center>Our story began in 1990 as a small courier delivery service company with big ambitions and bigger dreams. Our vision was to not just build a business, but to build enduring and close ties with our customers, while offering them a broad range of services. 25 years later, and over 10,000 locations across the globe,COURIERWALE has grown from your next-door courier shop to a multinational logistics company. As strategic partners of DPD, owned by the international brand GeoPost, our story has reached a new chapter as India’s largest parcel delivery network.</center></p>

		<th><p>Though an international courier service, DTDC believes social responsibility begins at home. That’s why our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is just not practising corporate philanthropy, but more about community-based development, known as “Creating Shared Value” or CSV. This unique business model, started in 1990, was the brainchild of DTDC’s founder Mr. Subhasish Chakraborty, the present CMD. The aim was simple: create and share wealth amongst thousands of people by making them entrepreneurs, who in turn create more job-opportunities. Today, 10,500+ DTDC-backed entrepreneurs have created job opportunities for over 30,000 people. Our multinational shipping company believes in philanthropy that goes hand-in-hand with corporate success. Apart from e-commerce trading, DTDC also contributes to a wide range of issues including health, hygiene, education, empowerment of women and children, disaster relief, and rural upliftment.</p></th>
